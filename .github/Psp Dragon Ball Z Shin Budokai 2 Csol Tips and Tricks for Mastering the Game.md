If you are a fan of Dragon Ball Z and you own a PSP, you might want to try this game out. Here are some steps on how to play Dragon Ball Z: Shin Budokai 2 on PSP:
 
1. First, you need to have a PSP that is compatible with custom firmware (CFW). CFW allows you to run homebrew applications and games that are not officially supported by Sony. You can check your PSP model and firmware version by going to Settings > System Settings > System Information. If you have a PSP 1000, 2000, or 3000 model with firmware version 6.60 or lower, you can install CFW using this guide: [https://wololo.net/cfw4dummies/](https://wololo.net/cfw4dummies/). If you have a PSP Go or a PSP E1000 model, you can use this guide instead: [https://hackinformer.com/PlayStationGuide/PSP/DEVICE\_PSP.html](https://hackinformer.com/PlayStationGuide/PSP/DEVICE_PSP.html). Be careful when installing CFW and follow the instructions carefully, as doing it wrong can brick your PSP.
2. Next, you need to download the ISO file of Dragon Ball Z: Shin Budokai 2. An ISO file is a digital copy of a game disc that can be played on emulators or CFW-enabled devices. You can find the ISO file of Dragon Ball Z: Shin Budokai 2 on various websites, such as [CDRomance](https://cdromance.com/psp/dragon-ball-z-shin-budokai-2-europe/) or [EmuParadise](https://www.emuparadise.me/PSP_ISOs/Dragon_Ball_Z_-_Shin_Budokai_Another_Road_%28USA%29/156432). Make sure to download the version that matches your PSP region (USA, Europe, Japan, etc.). The file size should be around 500 MB.
3. After downloading the ISO file, you need to transfer it to your PSP. Connect your PSP to your computer using a USB cable and enable USB mode on your PSP by going to Settings > USB Connection. Your PSP should appear as a removable drive on your computer. Open the drive and create a folder named ISO if it does not exist already. Copy and paste the ISO file of Dragon Ball Z: Shin Budokai 2 into the ISO folder. Safely eject your PSP from your computer and exit USB mode.
4. Finally, you need to launch the game on your PSP. Go to Game > Memory Stick and look for the icon of Dragon Ball Z: Shin Budokai 2. Select it and press X to start the game. Enjoy!
