To download QXDM Professional Full 11, you need to have a subscription-based license from Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI). You can contact salesops.testtools@qualcomm.com for a quotation[^1^]. Once you have a license, you can access the tool installer from https://createpoint.qti.qualcomm.com/[^1^]. You will also need to install the Qualcomm USB driver to establish the connection between your device and QXDM Professional[^1^].
 
To use QXDM Professional for diagnostic services, you need to have the IP Interface control document that specifies the diagnostic packet structure and parameter descriptions[^1^]. You can use the real-time monitor to track diagnostic logs, events, and messages from the device. You can also capture diagnostic logs, events, and messages as .isf files for data analysis[^1^]. If you need any assistance, you can submit captured logs as .isf files to https://createpoint.qti.qualcomm.com/[^1^].
